# Solidity To-Do List Manager

A simple decentralized To-Do List application built with Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This smart contract allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks in a transparent and immutable way. Each user can maintain their own list of to-do items, mark them as completed, and view their current tasks.

**Note:** Since the specific code for `to_do_manager.sol` could not be accessed, this README provides a general structure. Please update it with details specific to your implementation.

## Features

*   **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
*   **View Tasks:** Users can retrieve and view their list of tasks.
*   **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Users can mark tasks as completed.
*   **Task Ownership:** (Potentially) Tasks are associated with the user who created them.
*   **(Other features based on your contract - e.g., delete tasks, set due dates, etc.)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (or yarn)
*   A development environment like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
*   An Ethereum wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    If using Hardhat or Truffle, you'll typically have a `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Compiling the Contract

Using Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Using Truffle:
```bash
truffle compile
```

### Deploying the Contract

Deployment scripts will vary based on your chosen framework (Hardhat/Truffle) and target network (local, testnet, mainnet).

**Example with Hardhat (to a local network):**
1.  Start a local Hardhat node:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat node
    ```
2.  Run your deployment script:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```

### Interacting with the Contract

You can interact with the deployed contract using:
*   **Hardhat/Truffle console:** For direct command-line interaction.
*   **Web3 libraries:** (e.g., `ethers.js`, `web3.js`) in a frontend application.
*   **Remix IDE:** By deploying the contract or connecting to an existing instance.

## Usage Examples

*(Please replace these with actual function names and parameters from your `to_do_manager.sol` contract)*

**Adding a task (conceptual):**
```javascript
// Using ethers.js
const tx = await toDoListManager.createTask("Buy groceries");
await tx.wait();
```

**Getting tasks (conceptual):**
```javascript
const tasks = await toDoListManager.getTasks();
console.log(tasks);
```

**Marking a task as complete (conceptual):**
```javascript
const tx = await toDoListManager.toggleCompleted(taskId); // Assuming taskId is the identifier
await tx.wait();
```

## Contract Structure (to_do_manager.sol)

*(Provide a brief overview of your contract's structure, key state variables, and functions here once you can access the code or based on your knowledge of it.)*

Example:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ToDoManager {
    struct Task {
        uint id;
        string content;
        bool completed;
        // Add other relevant fields
    }

    // State variables
    // Mappings, arrays for tasks
    // Events

    // Functions
    // constructor()
    // function createTask(string memory _content) public { ... }
    // function getTask(uint _taskId) public view returns (Task memory) { ... }
    // function toggleCompleted(uint _taskId) public { ... }
    // ... other functions
}
```
