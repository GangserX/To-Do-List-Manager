# Solidity To-Do List Manager üìù

A decentralized To-Do List application built with Solidity, allowing users to manage tasks on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

This smart contract empowers users to create, track, and manage their personal tasks in a transparent and immutable manner. Key functionalities include adding tasks, marking them as complete, and viewing task summaries (total, completed, and pending tasks).

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks to your personal to-do list.
*   **View Tasks:** Retrieve and display your current tasks.
*   **Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete:** Toggle the completion status of tasks.
*   **Task Counts:** Get a summary of your tasks, including:
    *   Total number of tasks.
    *   Number of completed tasks.
    *   Number of pending tasks.
*   **Ownership:** Tasks are associated with the Ethereum address that created them.
*   **(Potentially other features like: Delete Tasks, Set Due Dates, Task Prioritization - *please update if your contract supports these*).**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended) & npm (or yarn)
*   A Solidity development environment like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
*   An Ethereum wallet extension like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for browser interaction.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if your project is on GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Assuming you have a `package.json` for Hardhat/Truffle)
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Compiling the Contract

**Using Hardhat:**
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

**Using Truffle:**
```bash
truffle compile
```
This will generate the ABI and bytecode for `to_do_manager.sol`.

### Deploying the Contract

Deployment scripts will depend on your chosen framework and target network (e.g., local development network, testnet, or Ethereum mainnet).

**Example Deployment with Hardhat (to a local Hardhat Network):**

1.  Ensure you have a deployment script in your `scripts/` directory (e.g., `deploy.js`):
    ```javascript
    // scripts/deploy.js
    async function main() {
      const ToDoManager = await ethers.getContractFactory("ToDoManager"); // Ensure 'ToDoManager' matches your contract name
      console.log("Deploying ToDoManager...");
      const toDoManager = await ToDoManager.deploy();
      await toDoManager.deployed();
      console.log("ToDoManager deployed to:", toDoManager.address);
    }

    main()
      .then(() => process.exit(0))
      .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
      });
    ```

2.  Start a local Hardhat node (in a separate terminal):
    ```bash
    npx hardhat node
    ```

3.  Run your deployment script:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```

### Interacting with the Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using:

*   **Hardhat/Truffle Console:** For direct command-line interaction.
    ```bash
    npx hardhat console --network localhost
    # then in the console:
    # const ToDoManager = await ethers.getContractFactory("ToDoManager");
    # const toDoManager = await ToDoManager.attach("YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS");
    # await toDoManager.createTask("My first task!");
    ```
*   **Web3 Libraries:** Integrate with a frontend using `ethers.js` or `web3.js`.
*   **Remix IDE:** Import the contract code and interact via its UI, connecting to your deployed instance.

## üìú Contract Functions (Key Examples)

*(Please verify these function names and parameters against your `to_do_manager.sol` and update as necessary. Add other important functions.)*

*   `createTask(string memory _content)`: Adds a new task with the given content.
*   `toggleCompleted(uint256 _taskId)`: Marks a task as completed or incomplete.
*   `getTasks()`: Returns an array of tasks for the caller.
*   `getTaskCount()`: Returns a tuple `(total, completed, pending)` representing the task counts for the caller.
*   `getTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Retrieves a specific task by its ID.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Testing

*(Describe how to run tests if you have them set up.)*

**Example with Hardhat:**
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
